# Software-Development
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
You see what the customer wants and communicate with your team to see how to do this. User stories helps with this because it explains the exact thing customer wants without any micommunication.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach them by estimating the time I will need and communicate with the customer to figure out exactly what they want. Then start developing the product with my teammembers in constant communication with them

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member is communicating effeciently, working effeciently, and hearing everybody out.
